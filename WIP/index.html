            <h1>Flexbox & Grid Layout Playground</h1>
            <p>CSS Flexbox and Grid are powerful layout tools that help web developers create responsive and flexible designs with ease. Flexbox is ideal for designing one-dimensional layouts, arranging elements in a row or column and distributing space dynamically.</p>
            <p>Grid, on the other hand, is perfect for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to position elements both horizontally and vertically across a grid system. Together, these tools simplify layout challenges, making it easier to build responsive websites that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.</p>
